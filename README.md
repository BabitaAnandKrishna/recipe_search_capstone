# recipe_search_capstone

A new Flutter project.

## Recipe Search

In this App we can search recipe for given ingredients. 
Just I am using Edamam Recipe API.

Here we can search recipe according to four required and one optional parameter.
mandatory params:
User has to input Ingredients, number of recipes, minimum and maximum number of calories. 
optional params:
